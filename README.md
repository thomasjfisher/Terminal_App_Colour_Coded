## Software Development Plan

### Statement of Purpose

Colour Coded has been designed to entertain you and brighten up your day! It is a fun memory game which requires you to be alert and pay attention when playing! Its a great way to help cheer you up, and also a great way keep your mind sharp and most importantly, have fun!

I created Colour Coded after only coding for 4 weeks! I am incredibly proud of what I have achieved in the given time frame of 1 week in order to complete Colour Coded. In doing so, I have learned so many new skills which have helped me to becoming a better developer.

#### What will Colour Coded do? 

When you launch the game, you will be welcomed at the main menu. There it will give you a list of options to progress. There will be 3 options. 

1. Selecting 1 will let you play Colour Coded. If you are a returning player and are familiar with Colour Coded, then you can jump straight in to the fun!

2. Selecting 2 will lead you to read the rules. If you are a first time player, we highly recommend viewing the rules page to familiarise yourself with Colour Coded.
3. Will allow you to exit the program.

When launching the game, it will greet you, get your name, and get you ready to play! It will then ask the user if they want to play. If the user hits 'y', the game will begin. If the user hits 'n', the game will exit. When launched, there will be a coloured word that you will be required to remember. It will flash on the screen for a short period of time, then the screen will be wiped. The user will then be prompted to enter their guess! Sounds easy right? Of course! All you have to do is remember to remember! When the word is guessed correctly, the user will get a randomised message congratulating them. After that, the screen is again cleared and then two words will appear on the screen, and then the words will be wiped. Again, the user will be prompted to enter their guess of what the coloured words were. This will continue until  5 words have been guessed correctly in a row, or if the 3 guesses have been used up. This app will solve all your boredom and stimulate your brain, all whilst filling the user with colourful joy!

#### Target Audience 

The target audience that Colour Coded has been designed for are gamers and people of all skill levels. Even if you're not a gamer, you will find enjoyment in Colour Coded. It will brighten up your day and always leave you with a smile on your face!

#### How the audience will use Colour Coded

Colour Coded will be launched from an executable file. It will install the gems required to play the game.

## Features

#### Feature 1

The main feature in Colour Coded, is the randomly generated coloured words. The code is written so that the coloured words printed to the screen will not repeat. In doing this, it is increasing the difficulty of Colour Coded. We have incorporated colour on top of colour, loops within loops, in order to make this game, not only as enjoyable as possible, but also slightly difficult for the users! By making the words appear in various colours, and then getting the user to type out the coloured words in order, Colour Coded is stimulating the brain and the short term memory function! How good is that? You're having fun, learning AND improving your brain function! In order to make sure this feature worked, I did a lot of manual testing, incorporated the use of class methods, loops and variables. Overall it has helped in making a smooth running game.

#### Feature 2

**"Short-term memory** (or "**primary**" or "**active memory**") is the capacity for holding, but not manipulating, a small amount of [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information) in [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind) in an active, readily available state for a short period of time" - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-term_memory

Colour Coded incorporates the stimulation of short term memory of the users. So not only are the users having fun and playing an enjoyable game, they are also learning and improving brain function! One feature that Colour Coded is incredibly proud of.

#### Feature 3

The 3rd feature that I am really proud of in Colour Coded, is the Graphical User Interface (GUI). Colour Coded is brought to life by the use of a ruby get called lolize. One of the main factors that went in to the development of Colour Coded was ensuring that the user experience was one to remember! This is achieved with the help of lolize. The use of the rainbow colour throughout the program really excites and pleases users, all whilst they are having fun and enjoying playing the game.

## User Interaction and Experience

#### How will the user interact with Colour Coded

The user will be able to launch Colour Coded as an executable file, or run the file it in the CLI. They will be greeted by the Main Menu, where they will be given options to Play, Read Rules, or Quit.

![Main Menu](https://github.com/thomasjfisher/Terminal_App_Colour_Coded/blob/master/docs/Colour_Coded_User_Interaction_MainMenu.jpg)

If the user selects option 1, Play, it will launch into the game, and ask your name, and if you are ready to start. If the user selects option 2, it will show the the rules of the game. If option 3 is selected, it will exit the game.

Option 1.

Option 2.

![Rules](https://github.com/thomasjfisher/Terminal_App_Colour_Coded/blob/master/docs/Colour_Coded_Rules.jpg)

So, from here, the user will play through the game, you will be asked to remember the sequence of words. After 5 rounds of inputting the correct sequence, you win! You will then be prompted to play again. If, however, you do not guess the sequence correctly, after 3 incorrect guesses in a row, it is game over! Again, you will be prompted if you would like to play again.

You won!

Game Over

## Implementation Plan

Below is a link to my Trello page. I started on Tuesday 21th April by writing out plans to create my README.md file, constructed my list of 3 features and writing out some pseudo code. I Originally began working on another app idea I had, called Twogether. However, in the weeks time that we had, and what I thought was accomplishable, I stopped that, and confirmed that I would go ahead with Colour Coded. I am not disappointed. I gave myself until 5pm on Wednesday 22nd April to have the README.md and the list of features done, and allowed myself until Friday the 24th to have the pseudo code finalised and and begin coding, as these were my main priorities.  Then I took some more time over the weekend to think about what sort of features that I wanted to implement to Colour Coded in the future. I have set myself a time frame of 1 month, as this is a project that I am incredibly proud of and will work on so that I can make it the best that it can be! The long term goal here, is to have it in a store online to share with the world.

## Status Updates

### Status Update #1

The first update that I came across, was from day 1. When we were told that we were to create an app within the given time frame of a week, my first reaction was excitement. I love gaming. I love coding. What better way to combine the two things I love! I had many ideas running through my head. I could redo 'Snake', or 'Pong'. But my original ideas took over. I was drawn more to them than to the redevelopment of other games. I wanted to make a memory game. I wanted to incorporate fun, but also test the skills of the user. It was a close tie between Colour Coded, and another app idea I had called Twogether. Twogether pulled ahead, but only just. It was to be a card matching game. I ran into many issues of how to construct this game within ruby, within the given time frame. Upon reflection with my teacher, I reassessed. In order to create an app that worked, but also an app that I had time to work on, I decided to go with Colour Coded. This was on day 1 that I was tossing up between both, but finalised to go with Colour Coded. I am incredibly glad that I chose Colour Coded.

### Status Update #2

The second update for my code was on Saturday 25th April. I was using the ruby gem 'colorize' to give various colours to my app. However, the issue that I ran in to, was that when I would randomly generate a word from my array, the code would cross check it with 'colorize', to make sure that the coloured words, and the matching colour that 'colorize' would change it to, were not the same. It would then print to the screen. However, because I was grouping the words together, and then calling 'colorize', the words would all print out the same colour, which is not what I wanted. I searched google looking for answers, and then I came upon a ruby gem called 'lolize'. I installed it to see how it looked, and instantly my app came to life. This is exactly what I saw Colour Coded looking like in my head. So I replaced 'colorize' with 'lolize' and have no regrets. Looking back now, I could have created a method in which I could have named and assigned a colour from 'colorize' separately.

## Testing

I manually tested Colour Coded, checking for valid user inputs and then making sure that the code would not progress unless it had an answer that it wanted. If for example

![Error Handling in code](https://github.com/thomasjfisher/Terminal_App_Colour_Coded/blob/master/docs/Colour_Coded_Error_Handling.jpg)

I used this method many times to check the user input and make sure that it is a valid response so that the code can act accordingly.

Another method I used when manually testing, was to assign a true value to a variable, DEBUG. When set to a true value, I gave DEBUG many jobs. Mainly, I stopped it from clearing the terminal, so that I could see what was being printed to the screen. Another job I assigned to DEBUG, is to stop the code from executing 'sleep'. What 'sleep' does, is makes the code pause for an amount of time that you assign it. Now, when looping through a memory game, and not only having the terminal clear on you, but also pause when you are trying to work out errors, is more than enough to cause a headache. The most impressive job that I assigned to DEBUG, was assigning it the value of `user_input = word`. Now, what this let me do, is speed through my code to debug. No matter what word I entered when the code asked me for my guess, it would always return my input to be true! Pretty neat! What a time saver!
