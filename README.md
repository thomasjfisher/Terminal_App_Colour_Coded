3.  Will allow you to exit the program.

When launching the game, it will clear the terminal and will get you ready to play! You will see "Get ready!" come across the screen for 2 seconds, then it will be wiped. The coloured word that you will be required to input will flash on the screen for 1 second, then the screen will be wiped. You will then be prompted to enter your guess! Sounds easy right? Of course! All you have to do is remember to remember! When the word is guessed correctly, you will get a message saying well done. After that, the screen is again cleared and then two words will flash on the screen, displayed for 2 seconds, and then wiped. Again you will be prompted to enter your guess of what the coloured words were. This will continue until you get 5 words correct in a row, or if you use your 3 guesses up and have to restart.
