# Welcome to Colour Coded

## Software Development Plan

### Statement of Purpose

Colour Coded has been designed to entertain you and brighten up your day! It is a fun memory game which requires you to be alert and pay attention when playing! Its a great way to help cheer you up, and also a great way keep your mind sharp and most importantly, have fun!

I created Colour Coded after only coding for 4 weeks! I am incredibly proud of what I have achieved in the given time frame of 1 week in order to complete Colour Coded. In doing so, I have learned so many new skills which have helped me to becoming a better developer.

#### What will Colour Coded do? 

When you launch the game, you will be welcomed at the main menu. There it will give you a list of options to progress. There will be 3 options. 

1. Selecting 1 will let you play Colour Coded. If you are a returning player and are familiar with Colour Coded, then you can jump straight in to the fun!

2. Selecting 2 will lead you to read the rules. If you are a first time player, we highly recommend viewing the rules page to familiarise yourself with Colour Coded.
3. Will allow you to exit the program.

When launching the game, it will greet you, get your name, and get you ready to play! It will then ask the user if they want to play. If the user hits 'y', the game will begin. If the user hits 'n', the game will exit. When launched, there will be a coloured word that you will be required to remember. It will flash on the screen for a short period of time, then the screen will be wiped. The user will then be prompted to enter their guess! Sounds easy right? Of course! All you have to do is remember to remember! When the word is guessed correctly, the user will get a randomised message congratulating them. After that, the screen is again cleared and then two words will appear on the screen, and then the words will be wiped. Again, the user will be prompted to enter their guess of what the coloured words were. This will continue until  5 words have been guessed correctly in a row, or if the 3 guesses have been used up. This app will solve all your boredom and stimulate your brain, all whilst filling the user with colourful joy!

#### Target Audience 

The target audience that Colour Coded has been designed for are gamers and people of all skill levels. Even if you're not a gamer, you will find enjoyment in Colour Coded. It will brighten up your day and always leave you with a smile on your face!

#### How the audience will use Colour Coded

Colour Coded will be launched from an executable file. It will install the gems required to play the game.

## Features

#### Feature 1

The main feature in Colour Coded, is the randomly generated coloured words. The code is written so that the coloured words printed to the screen will not repeat. In doing this, it is increasing the difficulty of Colour Coded. We have incorporated colour on top of colour, loops within loops, in order to make this game, not only as enjoyable as possible, but also slightly difficult for the users! By making the words appear in various colours, and then getting the user to type out the coloured words in order, Colour Coded is stimulating the brain and the short term memory function! How good is that? You're having fun, learning AND improving your brain function! In order to make sure this feature worked, I did a lot of manual testing, incorporated the use of class methods, loops and variables. Overall it has helped in making a smooth running game.

#### Feature 2

**"Short-term memory** (or "**primary**" or "**active memory**") is the capacity for holding, but not manipulating, a small amount of [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information) in [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind) in an active, readily available state for a short period of time" - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-term_memory

Colour Coded incorporates the stimulation of short term memory of the users. So not only are the users having fun and playing an enjoyable game, they are also learning and improving brain function! One feature that Colour Coded is incredibly proud of.

#### Feature 3

The 3rd feature that I am really proud of in Colour Coded, is the Graphical User Interface (GUI). Colour Coded is brought to life by the use of a ruby get called lolize. One of the main factors that went in to the development of Colour Coded was ensuring that the user experience was one to remember! This is achieved with the help of lolize. The use of the rainbow colour throughout the program really excites and pleases users, all whilst they are having fun and enjoying playing the game.

## User Interaction and Experience

#### How will the user interact with Colour Coded

The user will be able to launch Colour Coded as an executable file, or run the file it in the CLI. They will be greeted by the Main Menu, where they will be given options to Play, Read Rules, or Quit.
