# Pseudo Code:

# 1. menu ->  Instructions to play the game, explaining what the game is and how can the exit game
# 2. display a random colour ( text and color should n't match) - 3 sec
# 3. clear the screen
# 4. print a message
# 5. get user input (answer)
# 6. match user input with the answer
# 7. increment counter
# 8. check if right or wrong. if answer was correct, loop and show next with counter(2,3,4,5) question
# 9. if wrong increase wrong_answer guess. loop on same level to show same number of words as the one you failed on.
# 10. if both the counters are met, if wrong, show game over. if correct show you won.
# 11. ask user if they want to play again and loop if yes, exit if no.
